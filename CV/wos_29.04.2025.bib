Title = {The Gravettian-Solutrean transition in westernmost Iberia: New data from

Abstract = {This study presents the analysis of the lithic assemblages from Layers 5
   and 4E (Terrace) of the site of Vale Boi (southern Portugal) and Levels
   U and T from Lapa do Picareiro (central Portugal). We aimed to
   understand the technological patterns and raw material exploitation
   during the Gravettian-Solutrean transition in westernmost Iberia and
   test the traditional models with assemblages from recently excavated
   sites, while expanding the geographic range. Results show the existence
   of two discrete phases in each site. The first, with high frequency of
   quartz use for bladelet production, seems to reflect the presence of a
   Terminal Gravettian horizon, as defined by Almeida (2000). The second,
   with some significant differences between sites, attests the presence of
   Vale Comprido technology and lower quartz frequencies at Vale Boi,
   representing a Proto-Solutrean occupation; and the presence of a blade
   component in Lapa do Picareiro that, together with the respective
   absolute chronology, may be attributed to a Proto-Solutrean or an Early
   Solutrean horizon. In general terms, this study allowed to confirm that
   the Terminal Gravettian and the Proto-Solutrean are discrete phases
   across the transition, in agreement with the Three-Phase model presented
   by Zilha?o (1997). It further consolidates the expansion of similar
   techno-cultural patterns to southern Portugal, which may be explained by
   the significant changes in the dynamic of social networks (Cascalheira
   and Bicho, 2013).},

Title = {On the Chronological Structure of the Solutrean in Southern Iberia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {The Solutrean techno-complex has gained particular significance over
   time for representing a clear demographic and techno-typological
   deviation from the developments occurred during the course of the Upper
   Paleolithic in Western Europe. Some of Solutrean's most relevant
   features are the diversity and techno-typological characteristics of the
   lithic armatures. These have been recurrently used as pivotal elements
   in numerous Solutrean-related debates, including the chronological
   organization of the techno-complex across Iberia and Southwestern
   France. In Southern Iberia, patterns of presence and/or absence of
   specific point types in stratified sequences tend to validate the
   classical ordering of the techno-complex into Lower, Middle and Upper
   phases, although some evidence, namely radiocarbon determinations, have
   not always been corroborative. Here we present the first comprehensive
   analysis of the currently available radiocarbon data for the Solutrean
   in Southern Iberia. We use a Bayesian statistical approach from 13
   stratified sequences to compare the duration, and the start and end
   moments of each classic Solutrean phase across sites. We conclude that,
   based on the current data, the traditional organization of the Solutrean
   cannot be unquestionably confirmed for Southern Iberia, calling into
   doubt the status of the classically defined type-fossils as precise
   temporal markers.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {255-260},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Researchers have long debated the impact of climate change on human
   culture and particularly in hunter-gatherer societies. Climate drifts,
   particularly abrupt ones, have been continuingly seen as major prompts
   for rapid technological and cultural innovation. Recent advances in
   paleoclimatic reconstructions and ongoing developments in the quality
   and chronological resolution of archeological data have allowed a better
   understanding of the extent to which patterns of specific environmental
   changes triggered modifications in the technological systems of
   hunter-gatherers. This volume brings together contributions addressing
   strategic changes in the organization of hunter-gatherer technologies as
   a response to drastic environmental shifts. It includes topics such as
   lithic, organic tools and ceramic production, pyrotechnology, hunting
   strategies, pigment processing, use of plants and adornments, starting
   with Middle Stone Age and ending with Mesolithic and coming from a
   diversity of geographical contexts. This introduction to the volume
   provides a general view on the continuing debate over cause and effect
   in the interplay between humans and climate with the aim to provide a
   better understanding of the role and magnitude of environmental
   determinism in the archeology of hunter-gatherers.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {This study presents new models on the origin, speed and mode of the
   wave-of-advance leading to the definitive occupation of Europe's

   c. 37 and 30 ka ago. These models provide the estimation for possible
   demic dispersal routes for AMH at a stable spread rate of c. 0.7
   km/year, with the likely origin in Central Europe at the site of
   Geissenklosterle in Germany and reaching all areas of the European
   landscape. The results imply that: 1. The arrival of the Gravettian
   populations into the far eastern European plains and to southern Iberia
   found regions with very low human occupation or even devoid of hominins;
   2. Human demography was likely lower than previous estimates for the
   Upper Paleolithic; 3. The likely early AMH paths across Europe followed
   the European central plains and the Mediterranean coast to reach to the
   ends of the Italian and Iberian peninsulas.},

   Palaeolithic in Southwesternmost Iberia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PALEOLITHIC ARCHAEOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {8},

Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {Analyses of raw materials and the distinction between local/regional and
   long-distance sources have proven invaluable for understanding the
   extensive movements, interactions, and social networks during the Upper
   Palaeolithic in the Iberian Peninsula. However, unlike other parts of
   Iberia, research on the management and acquisition of raw materials in
   the south and west of Iberia remains relatively underdeveloped. Despite
   significant knowledge about the technological practices of Palaeolithic
   hunter-gatherers from southern Portugal, particularly from studies
   conducted at the site of Vale Boi, there is a noticeable lack of focus
   on raw materials management. This paper presents the first comprehensive
   characterisation of chert raw materials from the Gravettian,
   Proto-Solutrean, and Solutrean occupations at Vale Boi, using both
   macroscopic and petrographic techniques. Our study reveals that the
   majority of chert found at Vale Boi originates locally, within a 20 km
   radius. However, a non-negligible portion of the chert comes from
   non-local sources, indicating > 200 km raw material circulation from
   central Portugal and southern Spain.},

Abstract = {In Western Europe, the Upper Paleolithic is marked by clear regional and
   diachronic technological differences. Some of these are most likely
   related with human adaptations to the Late Pleistocene environmental
   shifts. In this paper we focus on the rapid climatic change events and
   their influence on the Iberian regional ecology and vegetation cover.
   Based on those changes and their impact on the main Upper Paleolithic
   cultural phases in central and southern Portugal, we propose an
   explanatory model, to be tested in the future, where rapid climatic
   events, such as the D-O and Heinrich Events, have direct impact on the
   ecology and vegetation cover and this, in turn, cause changes in human
   adaptations in terms of mobility, settlement patterns, land use and
   technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Territoriality and the organization of technology during the Last
   Glacial Maximum in southwestern Europe},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Climate changes that occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) had
   significant consequences in human eco-dynamics across Europe. Among the
   most striking impacts are the demographic contraction of modern humans
   into southern refugia and the potential formation of a population
   bottleneck. In Iberia and southern France transformations also included
   the occurrence of significant technological changes, mostly marked by
   the emergence of a diverse set of bifacially-shaped stone projectiles.
   The rapid dissemination of bifacial technologies and the geographical
   circumscription of specific projectile morphologies within these regions
   have been regarded as evidence for: (1) the existence of a system of
   long-distance exchange and social alliance networks; (2) the
   organization of human groups into cultural facies with well-defined
   stylistic territorial boundaries. However, the degree and modes in which
   cultural transmission have occurred within these territories, and how it
   may have influenced other domains of the adaptive systems, remains
   largely unknown. Using southern Iberia as a case-study, this paper
   presents the first quantitative approach to the organization of lithic
   technology and its relationship to hunter-gatherers' territorial
   organization during the LGM. Similarities and dissimilarities in the
   presence of morphological and metric data describing lithic technologies
   are used as a proxy to explore modes and degrees of cultural
   transmission. Statistical results show that similarities in
   technological options are dependent on the chronology and geographical
   distance between sites and corroborate previous arguments for the
   organization of LGM settlement in Southern Iberia into discrete
   eco-cultural facies.},

Abstract = {Recent cross-disciplinary research in the Iberian Peninsula has revealed
   a synchronous pattern between rapid climate change and widespread
   cultural modifications during the Late Paleolithic. The beginning and
   development of each traditionally defined techno-complex is thought to
   be associated with different environmental conditions. A main contrast
   is put on the impact of cold and arid conditions at the onset of the
   Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and its coincidence with the development of
   blade/flake-size projectiles and bifacial technologies, against the
   dominance of bladelet-size backed points across more temperate and
   forested environments. Based on the long-recognized assumption that
   lithic technology operates within the broader context of Pleistocene
   human ecodynamics, here we test the hypothesis that climate-related
   lithic techno-typological changes across the Upper Paleolithic are
   linked to modifications in land-use patterns and settlement
   organization. We present statistical analysis comparing the
   Shannon-Weaver diversity index for retouched stone tool assemblages
   (used as proxy for site function) and locational parameters of a series
   of contexts from Central Portugal. The results show a trend of
   continuity and change between periods, with some of the most important
   deviations starting at the onset of the LGM, with the Heinrich Event 2
   associated with patterns of technological diversification and
   biocultural expansion.},

Abstract = {The impact of North Atlantic Heinrich 2 event (HE2) (26.5-24.3 ka cal
   BP) in Iberia is currently attested by a set of high resolution deep-sea
   cores, confirming a record of increasing aridity, lowered temperatures,
   and important changes in the vegetation cover. In Portugal, a reasonable
   number of archaeological sites are dated to this time-span, where
   significant changes in the economic and technological structures have
   been identified as a new cultural component: the Proto-Solutrean. Based
   on high-resolution paleoenvironmental data, chronological and
   archaeological evidence, our study demonstrates how HE2 might have been
   the main trigger for Proto-Solutrean cultural change. Technological
   intensification and diversification, as well as the adjustments made in
   land-use patterns towards an expansion of the social networks, are
   presented as the major climate-driven outcomes. Within the Panarchy and
   the Adaptive Cycle Model framework, these modifications consist of a
   Release and Reorganization moment of the hunter gatherer cultural
   systems that will lead to the appearance of the Solutrean technocomplex

Journal = {ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Levallois technology, a hallmark of Middle Palaeolithic stone tool
   manufacture, involves sophisticated core reduction strategies that have
   major implications for understanding human cognitive and technological
   evolution. However, traditional methods of analysing Levallois cores
   often fail to capture the nuanced variability in their morphology. This
   study introduces a novel application of three-dimensional geometric
   morphometrics (GM) to quantify the shape variability of Nubian Levallois
   cores from the Nile Valley and Dhofar regions. By employing this
   technique, we analysed core surfaces and preferential scar shapes,
   identifying distinct regional and technological patterns. Our results
   reveal significant inter-regional differences in core elongation and
   surface convexity, highlighting the importance of shape-oriented, rather
   than metric-based, analysis of prepared cores. This new GM approach
   offers a robust and replicable tool for investigating lithic variability
   and holds potential for broader applications in Palaeolithic research,
   enhancing our understanding of human technological adaptations.},

Title = {Human adaptive responses to climate and environmental change during the

Volume = {587-588},

Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {On the Iberian Peninsula, abrupt climate shifts during the Late
   Pleistocene impacted human and natural systems. Our knowledge of human
   adaptive responses to these climatic perturbations has improved in
   recent years with the development of new radiocarbon techniques that
   have increased the temporal resolution of cultural chronologies. At the
   same time, new high-resolution paleoclimatic records from Greenland ice
   cores, deep-sea sediment cores, speleothems, and microfaunal assemblages
   have permitted detailed paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Combined
   with the archaeological record of culture change, these data sets allow
   for a better understanding of the nature of human socio-ecological
   systems during the Late Pleistocene. Here we present new data on the
   Gravettian occupations at Lapa do Picareiro, a cave site in Portugal
   with a long continuous stratigraphic sequence spanning MIS 3 and 2. The
   ongoing excavation of Lapa do Picareiro has revealed at least three
   Gravettian levels with very different patterns of raw material use and
   technological reduction. The Early Gravettian levels contain a quartzite
   flake assemblage with several refitting clusters and a small chert
   assemblage with nosed endscrapers and bladelet technology. The Late or
   Terminal Gravettian level contains carinated endscraper/core-bladelet
   technology, mainly quartz, with chert blade production, and a few bone
   tools. The faunal assemblages also have a different character. Both
   contain a similar range of medium and large ungulates but the earlier
   Gravettian has a much richer and more diverse assemblage of small
   animals. These combined archaeological data sets provide a new
   perspective on Gravettian human adaptations in response to climate
   shifts, especially Heinrich Event 3 and Greenland Interstadials 4 and 3.},

   identified in the archaeological record from the late Pliocene through
   to the Holocene. During all phases of human evolution, bipolar knapping
   and wedging were applied by different hominin species in a wide range of
   ecological settings. Studies on lithic bipolar methods have mainly
   focused on understanding the functional aspects of this technology. This
   paper explores the variability of the application of these methods
   during the Paleolithic on a macro scale. Through the meta-analysis of
   published data from 167 sites, it is posited that the use of bipolar
   methods may have had a significant impact on hominin expansion,
   adaptation, and survival strategies. Furthermore, the recurrent use of
   bipolar methods is not only an indicator of its success as an adaptive
   strategy, but also of how hominins were able to evaluate different types
   of efficiency through time.},

Abstract = {Currently available data on the Pleistocene human occupation of the
   westernmost territories of Iberia attest to the presence of Middle
   Palaeolithic industries from c. 240 ka cal bp until c. 37 ka cal bp.
   Previous studies focusing on this time frame have suggested that Middle
   Palaeolithic populations were highly mobile and predominately utilised
   locally available raw materials, with many cave and open-air sites being
   located near fluvial settings. Other than these observations, no
   specific studies have focused on exploring the factors influencing human
   site location choice during that time range. Employing statistical and
   GIS approaches, this paper provides an initial assessment of spatial
   patterning in human settlement during the Middle Palaeolithic of
   westernmost Iberia. Results show that site locations are biased towards
   lower elevations and riverine settings and suggest that distance to
   rivers might have impacted the diversity and specific types of lithic
   raw materials used at each site. These results help to shed light on the
   particularities of Neanderthal adaptations in a region regarded as a
   refugium during periods of unfavourable climate during the Middle
   Palaeolithic.},

Title = {Shellmiddens as landmarks: Visibility studies on the Mesolithic of the

Year = {2014},
Volume = {36},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent studies on the Mesolithic shellmiddens of the Muge valley
   (Central Portugal) indicate that these sites must have had, by their
   size, aspect and integration in an increasing socially complex cultural
   system, a major impact on the landscape as monumental anthropogenic
   features. Their role as landmarks and, most probably, as centers for
   different social/functional units is expected to be manifested in a
   considerable visual prominence on the terrain. This paper focuses on the
   use of geospatial techniques and statistical analysis to assess
   visibility as a determinant factor for Mesolithic settlement location
   and social patterns in Muge. Results confirm a considerable importance
   for features such as visual prominence, intervisibility between several
   settlements and visual control of the environs. A significant dichotomy
   in the visibility properties of both riverbanks mirrors differences in
   the archaeological record of sites and suggest that some of these sites
   might have been special locales with social impact as cultural
   landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Creating frames of reference for chert exploitation during the Late
   Pleistocene in Southwesternmost Iberia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Southwestern Iberia has played a key role in characterizing Late
   Pleistocene human ecodynamics. Among other aspects of human behavior,
   chert procurement and management studies in this region have received
   increasing attention in the past two decades, especially focusing on the
   sites showing repeated human occupation, such as the case of Vale Boi
   (Southern Portugal). However, these studies have been very limited in
   their geographical scope, and mostly focused on brief macroscopic
   descriptions of the raw materials. To further our knowledge of the
   relationship between regional availability of raw materials and its
   impact on human adaptations and mobility, a more detailed approach to
   characterizing geological sources is needed. This paper characterizes
   chert raw materials location, diversity, and availability in a
   geologically well-defined region of southern Portugal - the Algarve.
   Through macroscopic and petrographic approaches, we provide a detailed
   characterization of geological chert sources to build a frame of
   reference for chert exploitation in the region. Our results show that
   there are four main chert formations in Algarve, and that despite the
   within-source variability, sufficient differences at macroscopic and
   petrographic levels are present to allow clear source attribution. These
   results provide a baseline for raw material studies in archaeological
   assemblages across southwestern Iberia, that will be essential to
   further characterize the dynamics of human behavior in some of the most
   important eco-cultural niches.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a new freeware digital system, based on
   Google/Android platforms, designed to be a fully integrated and
   customizable solution to record, manage, and share archaeological survey
   data. The core of the system is two custom smartphone/tablet
   applications, through which surveyors are able to retrieve geographical
   coordinates and relevant attribute data from archaeological locations,
   but also to perform onsite analysis of artifacts, including taking
   accurate measurements with digital calipers directly connected to the
   mobile devices. The system saves all data recovered in the devices'
   internal memory, as well as in a cloud-based spatial database (Google
   Fusion Tables), where data can be automatically shared and examined
   using a rather intuitive set of visualization tools to instantly make
   maps or produce exploratory charts. Using the example of a recent field
   survey project for Stone Age sites in Mozambique, we provide a detailed
   discussion of the creation and use of all hardware and software
   components of our solution that will allow other researchers to
   reproduce the methodology and customize the system to meet the needs of

Title = {Shell bead production in the Upper Paleolithic of Vale Boi (SW
   Portugal): an experimental perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {29-41},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, we focused on shell bead production during the Upper
   Paleolithic at the site of Vale Boi in Southwestern Portugal as a means
   of understanding social visual transmission. Vale Boi has a long
   sequence dated to between c. 32 and 7 ka cal BP with well-preserved bone
   and shell assemblages from early Gravettian to Neolithic times. The
   archaeological shell bead collection includes over 100 specimens from
   the Gravettian, Proto-Solutrean, Solutrean and Magdalenian layers from
   Vale Boi, including at least 5 species: Littorina obtusata or Littorina
   fabalis, Trivia sp., Antalis sp., Mitrella scripta and Theodoxus
   fluviatilis.
   Experimental replication techniques included scratching, sawing, and
   hammering using lithic and bone implements on both internal and external
   sides of the shells. Experimental results indicate that there are a
   series of potential fabrication techniques for bead production, but
   there is a clear tendency in the archaeological record to use a single
   technique for each shell species. There also seems to be a focus on
   using a fast technique rather than a slower one, which seems to produce
   higher quality results.
   Finally, we also address the topic of the impact of bead production
   techniques on the evolution of bead design technology through all Upper
   Paleolithic record in SW Portugal. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The coastal site of Vale Boi is unique in southern Portugal for its
   well-preserved and lengthy Upper Paleolithic cultural record. The
   archaeological context of Vale Boi suggests that the site was treated as
   a seasonal residential camp. Long-term exploitation of marine resources
   is indicated by marine shellfish remains and tentative evidence of
   fishing. High-level exploitation of rabbits (Oryctolagus) began with the
   initial use of Vale Boi (c. 28,000 BP) and continued throughout the
   duration of site occupation. Intensive grease-rendering of ungulate
   bones is demonstrated by the presence of impact features, reduced
   presence of skeletal portions associated with increased quantities of
   bone grease and a significant correlation between the fragmentation of
   red deer (Cervus elaphus) remains and the quantities of marrow and bone
   grease within these portions. Although grease rendering at Vale Boi
   pre-dates other known sites in Eurasia by several thousand years, faunal
   assemblages in Mediterranean Spain suggest that resource diversification
   connected with intensification may have appeared there coevally with
   Vale Boi. The application of models of diet breadth and patch-choice
   suggests that southern Iberia may not have had the large and medium game
   to easily support human consumer demand. Instead, foragers may have had
   to turn to novel approaches of resource harvesting to maintain their
   needs. This set of circumstances may have arisen from a patchy
   landscape, where resources were either spatially and/or seasonally
   restricted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Until recently, evidence of Neanderthal cave use in the Algarve
   (Southern Portugal) came only from the site of Ibn Ammar. Over the last
   couple of years, archaeological excavations inside another cave, Gruta
   da Companheira, yielded Mousterian stone tools associated with possible
   human fossils. The discovery of this assemblage is groundbreaking
   because it may contribute to enlighten the Neanderthal/cave relationship
   and explain the dearth of similar sites in the Algarve. Gruta da
   Companheira, however, is a complex karst system, which was partly
   destroyed during its accidental discovery. As result, the original
   entrance of the cave remains unknown, and it is unclear how sediments,
   archaeological materials and Neanderthals accessed the site. To tackle
   these issues, we combined geomorphological observations with
   speleological, Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and
   Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) prospections. Our data indicate that
   Gruta da Companheira was probably accessed from the hilltop through a
   sub-vertical entrance. Additionally, our results suggest the existence
   of yet unexplored shallower cavities connected with the already known
   passages of Gruta da Companheira. These results will guide the opening
   of new excavation areas at the site. The limestone bedrock hosting Gruta
   da Companheira has been extensively dissolved by karst processes.
   Therefore, it is necessary to focus future research on the cave
   infillings to clarify whether Neanderthals exploited the cave's inner
   chambers or alternatively limited their occupations to the hilltop and
   geogenic processes reworked their materials into the endokarst system
   shortly after their stays. The deep karstification and partial collapse
   of the hill hosting Gruta da Companheira are common in limestone
   outcrops that occur throughout the Western Algarve. Poor visibility and
   poor accessibility of this karst area, densely covered with shrubby
   vegetation, are factors that need to be considered when addressing the
   scarcity of Middle Palaeolithic cave sites in this region.},

Abstract = {The Gravettian is the most important phase for the technological and
   cultural setting of the Upper Paleolithic sequence in the Southwestern
   Iberian Peninsula. For the Gravettian record in this territory, the
   archaeological site of Vale Boi (Vila do Bispo, Cape St. Vicente,
   Portugal) provides one of the most complete chrono-stratigraphic
   sequences. This paper focus on technological and typological variability
   of the Gravettian lithic assemblages from Vale Boi, dated from c. 33 to
   c. 28 ka cal BP, and tests affinities with other Gravettian contexts
   from central Portugal and southern Spain. Technological analysis shows
   that Gravettian lithic assemblages from Vale Boi are characterized by
   reduction strategies focuses on flake and bladelet debitage. Backed
   technology represents the most important morph-type. However, instead of
   the so-called typical Gravettian points (i.e. Gravette and Microgravette
   points), the early Gravettian of Vale Boi is characterized by double
   backed and bipointed bladelets. Statistical analysis shows that data
   from Vale Boi represent a new insight on human technological and
   socio-cultural behaviour during the onset of Upper Paleolithic in
   Iberia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {359},

Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {The Gravettian in Portugal is known primarily from three main areas: the
   Coa valley, the central region between the Mondego and Tagus river
   valleys, and Algarve in the south. Each region seems to be represented
   by various cultural facies that likely correspond to different social
   networks with diverse technological, subsistence and settlement
   organization. Despite these differences, the Portuguese Gravettian
   appears to have had a similar emergence in each area, beginning at least
   in central and southern Portugal around 33 ka cal BP, and ending ca.
   26.5 ka cal BP with the appearance of the Proto-Solutrean.
   The present study focuses on the various aspects mentioned above,
   presenting the more recent dates for Portugal and the boundaries for the
   beginning and end of the Gravettian phase based on Bayesian modeling.
   The results suggest that there is a possibility of a two thousand years
   overlap between the late Mousterian and the Early Gravettian in central
   and southern Portugal; that the Early Gravettian started with the onset
   of the Heinrich Event 3 and lasted c. 4000 years, followed by the Late
   Gravettian and gave place to the Proto-Solutrean around 26.5 ka cal BP,
   with the beginning of the Heinrich Event 2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {The Upper Paleolithic of SW Iberia is marked by the presence of chopper
   and flake assemblages in quartzite. Detailed characterization at
   regional and chronological levels of these assemblages is of the utmost
   importance because, in the most Paleolithic recent phases, they can be
   found without type-fossils associated or in non-datable deposits. In
   this study, we used 24 quartzite assemblages from SW Iberia, to test the
   diagnostic character of this raw material through attribute analysis and
   refitting. Results indicate that Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian
   can be distinguished on their quartzite assemblages, enabling, by
   itself, the differentiation of the Upper Paleolithic key-sequence. They
   also indicate that Gravettian and Magdalenian assemblages are
   technologically closer to each other than to Solutrean, a pattern
   possibly related with the adaptation to the Last Glacial Maximum.},

   the most relevant and interesting prehistoric archeological contexts,
   interpreted has the result of intensive human ecological exploitation,
   and marked by new settlement and mobility patterns, and subsistence
   strategies. Based on techno-typological patterns and artifact density,
   each Muge shellmidden has been traditionally linked to a single and
   specific functionality, possibly reflecting the presence of different
   stylistic/ethnic groups in the territory. Therefore, characterizing
   settlement, mobility, site function, and technological patterns in each
   shellmidden is fundamental to understand the archeological record and
   answer major questions related to human ecological behavior during the
   onset of the new Holocene climatic setting. This paper presents new data
   on the Mesolithic from the Tagus valley, using the case study of the
   lithic assemblage from layer 2 of Cabeco da Amoreira shellmidden. From
   our interpretation, by combining lithic raw material characterization
   and sourcing, techno-typological and use-wear analysis, this study aims
   to represent an important step on understanding resource exploitation,
   technological systems and site function, in order to address intra and
   inter-site variability. In what concerns lithic raw materials, they can
   be found in the Pleistocene gravels that compose the upper section of
   the Cenozoic deposits of the River Tagus, including those underneath the
   site. Nevertheless, the geochemical results suggest that the chert used
   has correspondence with local, regional, and exogenous areas. In sum, by
   characterizing the Cabeco da Amoreira shellmidden lithic assemblage,
   results and data aim to contribute to the discussion and new
   interpretations on shellmiddens' function and settlement occupation
   patterns during the Mesolithic.},

Abstract = {It is now rather evident that, concomitant with the advent, growth and
   disappearance of the traditionally defined Western European Upper
   Paleolithic techno-complexes, a series of discrete eco-cultural niches
   would have existed within Iberia.
   Vale Boi, and its surroundings, may represent one of these niches, since
   its lengthy and fairly complete archaeological record clearly attests
   that the region was an attractive location for hunter-gatherer
   communities for over 10,000 years.
   From the first Modern Human occupations, c. 32 ka cal BP ago, a set of
   very specific cultural adaptive markers seem to have been developed in
   response to the particularities of the regional ecological background.
   Some of these strategies, such as intensive subsistence practices,
   raw-material specialized use, among others, were resilient through time
   and apparently impermeable to the major shifts in the techno-typological
   novelties brought about with the advent of each Upper Paleolithic phase.
   Even with the appearance of quite unique and broad-scale technologies,
   e. g. Solutrean, regional markers and identity have been kept, clearly
   showing that each level of the adaptive system seem to have operate at
   its own pace.
   This paper focus on long-term adaptive choices and on how and why
   hunter-gatherers inhabiting Vale Boi manage to absorb change and
   re-organize their system under new techno-complex cultural patterns
   while still retaining, efficiently, the same regional adaptive
   idiosyncrasies.
   Within the theoretical framework of Panarchy and the cross-scale
   resilience model we argue that cross-scale interactions between creative
   and conserving niche-specific behavioral adaptations were the keystone
   for the sustainability of hunter-gatherer cultural systems across the
   Late Pleistocene. c (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Title = {Chronology of the Mesolithic occupation of the Muge valley, central

Volume = {308},

Abstract = {Although the Muge shellmiddens have been the object of research and
   excavation for almost 150 years, data are still scarce and, frequently,
   problematic. The chronology of the Mesolithic occupation of Muge is
   based on a series of radiocarbon dates from various sites. These results
   allowed the establishment of upper and lower boundaries for the
   Mesolithic in the region, as well as for the sequencing and the cultural
   explanations of both sites and lithic technology. However, most of those
   dated samples have insoluble problems of provenience and stratigraphy
   and, thus, the dates have very little significance for the knowledge of
   the chronology of the sites and of the Mesolithic human occupation in
   the valley.
   Recently, a new project, started in 2008, was funded by the Portuguese
   National Science Foundation (FCT). This paper presents the first AMS
   results of this project, with a total of close to 30 new dates, based on
   Bayesian radiocarbon dating modelling. These, together with previous
   obtained radiocarbon results, provide a complete and detailed new
   perspective of the chronology of one of the most important shellmiddens
   (Cabeco da Amoreira) in Muge as well as the direct relation to the time
   of settlement of Mesolithic complex hunter-gatherers in the region and
   the following occupation with the reuse of the shellmiddens by Neolithic
   populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The environmental shifts during the Late Pleistocene had major
   influences in the landscape and, consequently, in the available
   resources. This had direct impact on human behavior and ecology,
   requiring people to constantly adjust to new economical conditions. In
   coastal areas, the retreat of the shoreline during the colder phases
   might have made available presently underwater raw material sources in
   the form of outcrops and gravels, eventually making it easier to gather
   lithic raw materials.
   In this paper, we present our preliminary results on the diachronic
   variability of raw materials in Vale Boi. Vale Boi is a coastal site,
   located 2.5 km from the present coastline, in the margins of a
   freshwater stream. The site has three different loci, all rich in
   lithics, fauna (including marine), bone tools, adornments, charcoal, and
   ochre, and evidence of continuous human occupation from c. 33 to 15.6 ka
   cal BP. This chronostratigraphic record makes it a perfect study case
   for the understanding of coastal populations' behavior and economy
   throughout the Upper Paleolithic.
   Our objective is to infer the territory of resources exploitation,
   landscape, and economic patterns. Raw material sources are usually fixed
   points on the landscape (in contrast to other resources such as fauna
   and flora) and, therefore, are one of the best ways of understanding how
   people moved in the landscape and, consequently, to infer past human
   behavior. We used a macroscopic approach in both the archaeological and
   the geological record in order to correlate sources and artifacts.
   Despite the absence of detailed quantitative data on each chert type,
   our results show that the hunteregatherers who occupied Vale Boi during
   the Upper Paleolithic not only used several raw materials but also a
   variety of sources of the same raw material. This happened both
   diachronically and synchronically, suggesting that not only the complete
   sequence as well as each archaeological layer seem to have had a
   considerable economic complexity with the use of adjacent and distal
   sources. With this paper, we aim to present updated information on the
   variability of raw materials at Vale Boi, including the chert
   assemblages, along with new chert sources in order to establish a basis
   for a future detailed study on the raw material sourcing at the site.

Abstract = {During the 2014 archaeological campaign in the Mesolithic shell midden
   of Cabeco da Amoreira (Muge, Central Portugal) a concentration over a
   small area, approximately 1 m(2), of faunal remains with a single taxon
   (red deer), lithics, charcoal and fire-cracked rocks was identified in
   one of the shell-rich layers of the mound.
   Here we present the results of the analysis of bone and lithic materials
   coming from that feature, as well as refitting data from both classes
   and correspondent GIS-based spatial analysis, using Kernel Density
   Estimation and Ripley's K function. All these procedures allowed the
   identification of non-random density patterns, the definition of clear
   spatial limits for the feature, and to attest the unique character of
   the context as a single depositional event within the Cabeco da Amoreira
   shell mound. Alternative hypothesis for the natural and cultural
   processes involved in the formation of the feature are suggested,
   including the possibility that it corresponds to a refuse disposal of a
   short episode of carcass processing but also that some social-based

Abstract = {Evidence for the first Neolithic population in central Portugal dates to
   as early as c. 7600 cal BP. These first farmers were exogenous groups
   arriving to the Atlantic coast from the Mediterranean Sea. For a few
   centuries there seems to have occurred an overlap in the region between
   the Mesolithic Muge huntergatherers and the regional early Neolithic
   populations. While the trajectory of these first farmers seems to be
   well established, the fate of the Mesolithic populations is unknown and
   in generally assumed as resulting in extinction. The recent results from
   research in the Muge Mesolithic shellmounds (Tagus valley) with the new
   recovery of various loci with Neolithic occupations including human
   burials, human DNA, and Strontium analyses seem to indicate evidence of
   cultural and genetic integration between the Mesolithic and Neolithic
   populations.
   This paper will focus on the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in
   Portuguese Estremadura and examines the hypothesis that human resilience
   promoted the cultural and biological integration of the Mesolithic
   groups into the new exogenous Neolithic communities in central Portugal.

Title = {Mandibular morphology and the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in
   Westernmost Iberia},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},

Abstract = {Neolithic farming and animal husbandry were first developed in the Near
   East similar to 10,000 BCE and expanded westwards, reaching westernmost
   Iberia no later than 5500 BCE. It resulted in major social, cultural,
   economic and dietary changes. Yet, the impact of this change on human
   mandibular morphology in Iberia is yet to be assessed, which is
   regrettable because mandible form is impacted by population history and
   diet. In this study we used Mesolithic to Chalcolithic Iberian samples
   to examine the impact of this transition on mandibular morphology. We
   also compared these samples with a Southern Levantine Chalcolithic
   population to assess their relationship. Lastly, we assessed dental wear
   to determine if the morphological differences identified were related to
   the material properties of the diet. We found differences between
   samples in mandibular shape but not size, which we attribute to
   contrasting population histories between Mesolithic and later
   populations. Some differences in the severity of dental wear were also
   found between Mesolithic and later Iberian samples, and smaller between
   the Mesolithic Iberians and southern Levantines. Little relationship was
   found between wear magnitude and mandibular shape. Altogether, our
   results show that the Mesolithic-Neolithic Iberian transition resulted
   in a meaningful change in mandibular morphology, which was likely driven
   more by population history than by dietary change.},

Abstract = {Under the auspices of the Portuguese colonial government, Lereno
   Barradas and Santos Junior (coordinator of the Anthropological Mission
   of Mozambique) carried out several archaeological field surveys from
   1936 to 1956 that resulted in a data set that includes a total of close
   to 90 sites, mostly attributed to the Stone Age. This early research
   added to the previous work of Van Riet Lowe in the Limpopo Valley of
   southern Mozambique. With the new millennium, Mozambique has emerged as
   a crucial geographic area in which to understand the various hypotheses
   about recent human evolution. Specifically, its coastal location between
   southern and eastern Africa is ideal for testing ideas about the link
   between early coastal adaptations and the appearance of anatomically
   modern humans (AMH). Except for the recent work by Mercader's team in
   northern Mozambique, the number of researchers and projects on this
   topic in Mozambique is still limited because of the general predominance
   of interest in later periods among archaeologists working in the
   country, mainly due to their focus on issues related to precolonial
   heritage and national identity. Based on the early maps from Santos
   Junior and more recent data acquired through various projects, we
   present a series of maps for the Stone Age prehistory of Mozambique. The
   maps are also based on a critical evaluation of the sites and a review
   of some of the materials that are presently curated at the Instituto de
   Investigacao Cientifica e Tropical (IICT) in Lisbon, Portugal, as well
   as the materials stored at the Department of Archaeology of Universidade
   Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo. The sites are also presented in an online
   database with the information on all sites used in this study. This
   database is open to all and will be updated continuously. A preliminary
   interpretation of the regional distribution of the sites is also
   attempted, linking aspects that include region, topography and altitude,
   geomorphology, and cultural phase. These results will be the first step
   for research and knowledge in Mozambique on Stone Age prehistory and the
   emergence and settlement pattern of AMH.},

Title = {Late Glacial and Early Holocene human demographic responses to climatic

Abstract = {Successive generations of hunter-gatherers of the Late Glacial and Early
   Holocene in Iberia had to contend with rapidly changing environments and
   climatic conditions. This constrained their economic resources and
   capacity for demographic growth. The Atlantic facade of Iberia was
   occupied throughout these times and witnessed very significant
   environmental transformations. Archaeology offers a perspective on how
   past human population ecologies changed in response to this scenario.
   Archaeological radiocarbon data are used here to reconstruct
   demographics of the region over the long term. We introduce various
   quantitative methods that allow us to develop palaeodemographic and
   spatio-temporal models of population growth and density, and compare our
   results to independent records of palaeoenvironmental and palaeodietary
   change, and growth rates derived from skeletal data. Our results
   demonstrate that late glacial population growth was stifled by the
   Younger Dryas stadial, but populations grew in size and density during
   the Early to Middle Holocene transition. This growth was fuelled in part
   by an increased dependence on marine and estuarine food sources,
   demonstrating how the environment was linked to demographic change via

Abstract = {This paper will focus on the ecology of the first Anatomically Modern
   Humans in SW Iberia based on the rock shelter of Vale Boi (Algarve,
   Portugal), a site with a long stratigraphic record starting with Late
   Middle Paleolithic followed by early Gravettian, Proto-Solutrean,
   Solutrean, and Magdalenian. Early Gravettian remains are present in
   various areas and different levels of the site, and are dated to c. 32
   ka cal BP, corresponding to the earliest modern human occupation in SW
   Iberia. These communities most likely came from the Iberian
   Mediterranean coast as bone technology and body ornaments seem to
   confirm. The Gravettian of Vale Boi provides clear evidence of an
   intensification and diversification of dietary resources from very
   early, including the use of grease-rendering. Here, reconstruction of
   the Gravettian human ecology at Vale Boi is based on the diversity of
   human occupations, focusing mostly on diachronic changes in the patterns
   of resources acquisition and land-use, but also on subsistence,
   technological, social and symbolic elements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {Located between modern-day South Africa and Tanzania, both of which have
   well-known and extensive Stone Age records, Mozambique's Stone Age
   sequence remains largely unknown in the broader context of African
   Pleistocene prehistory. Such lack of data occurs despite the key
   geographical location of the country, in southern Africa at the
   southeastern tip of the Great Rift Valley. As such, Mozambique is an
   area of interest to evaluate the origins and dispersion of Homo sapiens
   within Africa, particularly in relation to Middle Stone Age contexts and
   associated early modern human ecology and cognition.
   This paper focuses on preliminary survey results from the Niassa
   District, near Lake Niassa (also known as Lake Malawi) in northern
   Mozambique. The results include the discovery and location of more than
   80 new surface lithic concentration localities, as well as data from two
   new sites, the open air surface site of Ncuala and the rock shelter of
   Chicaza. For Chicaza we provide a series of new radiocarbon dates for
   the Iron Age and Late Stone Age occupations based on preliminary testing
   carried out at the site. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Abstract = {Mollusk shells are often found in archeological sites, given their great
   preservation potential and high value as a multipurpose resource, and
   they can often be the only available materials useful for radiocarbon
   (C-14) dating. However, dates obtained from shells are often regarded as
   less reliable compared to those from bones, wood, or charcoals due to
   different factors (e.g., Isotope fractionation, reservoir effects etc.).
   The standard acid etching pretreatment for mollusk shells is the most
   used in many C-14 laboratories, although another protocol known as CarDS
   (Carbonate Density Separation) was introduced just over a decade ago. We
   compare these two methods with two newly proposed methods for
   intracellular organic matrix extraction. We applied all four methods to
   samples selected from different archeological layers of the well-known
   Upper Paleolithic site of Vale Boi, rich in mollusk specimens throughout
   the stratigraphic sequence. Here we compare our results to previous
   dates to determine which of these pretreatment methods results in the
   most reliable C-14 dates. Based on the results of this study, all four
   methods gave inconsistent ages compared to previous dates and the
   stratigraphic attribution.},

Abstract = {Adaptation to Late Pleistocene climate change is an oft-cited potential
   contributor to Neanderthal disappearance in Eurasia. Accordingly,
   research on Neanderthal behaviour - including subsistence strategies,
   mobility, lithic technology, raw material procurement and demography -
   often focuses on linking changes observable in the archaeological record
   to specific phases of climate and environmental change. However, these
   correspondences are often tenuous because palaeoclimatic and
   archaeological records are rarely available on the same scale. In
   Iberia, a critical location for understanding the demise of
   Neanderthals, some research indicates that Neanderthal populations were
   unable to recover from environmental degradations known as Heinrich
   Events, while other studies suggest that enclaves of Neanderthal
   populations survived for several millennia longer in refugial zones.
   Here, we present a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction study using
   analysis of delta C-13 and delta O-18 of herbivore tooth enamel
   recovered from two Mousterian deposits at Lapa do Picareiro, a site
   located in Portuguese Estremadura. We then use these data, combined with
   other site-based palaeoenvironmental indicators, to assess whether
   central Portugal acted as a refugium during periods of unfavourable
   climate, and to test whether Neanderthals in Portuguese Estremadura
   reorganised their mobility strategies after severe climate episodes.},

Abstract = {Documenting the first appearance of modern humans in a given region is
   key to understanding the dispersal process and the replacement or
   assimilation of indigenous human populations such as the Neanderthals.
   The Iberian Peninsula was the last refuge of Neanderthal populations as
   modern humans advanced across Eurasia. Here we present evidence of an
   early Aurignacian occupation at Lapa do Picareiro in central Portugal.
   Diagnostic artifacts were found in a sealed stratigraphic layer dated
   41.1 to 38.1 ka cal BP, documenting a modern human presence on the
   western margin of Iberia similar to 5,000 years earlier than previously
   known. The data indicate a rapid modern human dispersal across southern
   Europe, reaching the westernmost edge where Neanderthals were thought to
   persist. The results support the notion of a mosaic process of modern
   human dispersal and replacement of indigenous Neanderthal populations.},

Title = {Towards an understanding of the different uses of sheep/goat and hare in
   Iberian South-Western Bronze Age funerary contexts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Faunal remains associated with human burials are a well-known practice
   in Southern Portugal during the Middle Bronze Age (end of the third
   millennium until the first half of the second millennium BC). The
   funerary archi-tecture is mainly marked by hypogea, where articulated
   segments of anterior limbs or isolated bones from the front limbs of
   cattle or sheep/goat are present as grave goods. Along with hypogea,
   there are also examples of burial contexts in pits with faunal remains
   associated. This paper presents data on a circular pit from Montinhos 6
   (Southern Portugal) with two primary interments, where disarticulated
   sheep/goat and hare remains are included as grave goods. Some of the
   bones (both hare and sheep/goat) were included as dry bones, meaning
   that animal corpses were manipulated earlier. It allows considering the
   hypothesis that such animal remains have been used in a previous social
   context. The animal corpses decay, and some bones were chosen,
   collected, and lastly integrated within the funerary context. This
   treatment of the bones suggests a well-planned integration of the
   animals into the funerary rituals. Regarding the meaning of these faunal
   remains, one may interpret them as ``manipulated artefacts{''} or
   amulets, invoking graces for hunting and/or herding practices. In

Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {581-582},

Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {The Iberian Peninsula is considered one of the most well-suited regions
   in Europe to develop studies on the relationship between environmental
   changes and human adaptations across the Late Pleistocene. Due to its
   southwesternmost cul-de-sac position and eco-geographical diversity,
   Paleolithic Iberia was the stage of cyclical cultural/technological
   changes, linked to fluctuations in climate and environments, human
   demographics, and the size, extension, and type of social exchange
   networks.
   Such dynamics are particularly evident during the Last Glacial Maximum
   (LGM) timeframe, with a series of innovations emerging in the
   archaeological record, marking the transitions between the traditionally
   defined Gravettian, Proto-Solutrean, Solutrean, and Magdalenian
   technocomplexes.
   Stemming from a workshop organized in Erlangen in 2019 on ?The Last
   Glacial Maximum in Europe - state of knowledge in Geosciences and
   Archaeology?, this paper presents, in the first part, an updated review
   on the paleoenvironments and human adaptations across four macro-regions
   (Northern, Inland, Mediterranean, and Western Atlantic Fa?ade) in Iberia
   during the LGM; and, in a second part, a discussion on the pronounced
   interregional variability, unresolved research questions, and the most
   promising research topics for future studies.},

Title = {SPIN enables high throughput species identification of archaeological

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {Available methods to identify species from fragmented archaeological
   bone and remains suffer a trade-off between cost and resolution. Here,
   the authors present a workflow that uses automated sample preparation,
   10 to 20 times faster data acquisition, and computerized data
   interpretation to make the technology applicable to large-scale studies.
   Species determination based on genetic evidence is an indispensable tool
   in archaeology, forensics, ecology, and food authentication. Most
   available analytical approaches involve compromises with regard to the
   number of detectable species, high cost due to low throughput, or a
   labor-intensive manual process. Here, we introduce ``Species by Proteome
   INvestigation{''} (SPIN), a shotgun proteomics workflow for analyzing
   archaeological bone capable of querying over 150 mammalian species by
   liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Rapid peptide
   chromatography and data-independent acquisition (DIA) with throughput of
   200 samples per day reduce expensive MS time, whereas streamlined sample
   preparation and automated data interpretation save labor costs. We
   confirm the successful classification of known reference bones,
   including domestic species and great apes, beyond the taxonomic
   resolution of the conventional peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF)-based
   Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) method. In a blinded study
   of degraded Iron-Age material from Scandinavia, SPIN produces
   reproducible results between replicates, which are consistent with
   morphological analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the high throughput
   capabilities of the method in a high-degradation context by analyzing
   more than two hundred Middle and Upper Palaeolithic bones from Southern
   European sites with late Neanderthal occupation. While this initial
   study is focused on modern and archaeological mammalian bone, SPIN will
   be open and expandable to other biological tissues and taxa.},
